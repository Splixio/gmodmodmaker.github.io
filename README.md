Program
=======
This program is based on the open-source
[webgl-loader](http://code.google.com/p/webgl-loader/) project by Won
Chun. It is based on r82 with many little additions to the converter. The
output should be completely compatible with the original program. The
objnormalize program was written by myself, and its functionality is now
(in part) integrated into the original webgl-loader.


Samples
-------
The samples directory contains a _very_ basic WebGL viewer for the
produced models. It has problems with scale sometimes and does not show
the backs of surfaces.


Online Version
--------------
You can go to
[webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu/obj-viewer/](http://webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu/obj-viewer/)
for an online-usable version of the program.
